for now this speech to text app works locally but not in the Heroku cloud. Why? This is because a streamlit/heroku app is hosted server side, therefore my Python code will try to listen to the server's micro... and will obviosuly result in an error. Solution? WOuld be to run the code client side, meaning Javascript. I found this piece of code: https://discuss.streamlit.io/t/speech-to-text-on-client-side-using-html5-and-streamlit-bokeh-events/7888 , but it seems to only work in the Chrome browser and recognize only English. In addition, I cannot tailor that piece of code.
